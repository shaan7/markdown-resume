  Laid the foundations, implemented and maintained SoStronk's cross-platform desktop application. Based on Qt5/QML and a focus on performance, the app's fluid interface helps players find the matches they are interested in.

: *CS:GO Matchmaking (based on Go and Google Cloud)*
  Started from scratch and implemented a Glicko2-based matchmaking platform. The delicate balance of "the best match" and "the quickest match" was the result of algorithm optimizations that leverage knowledge about the game.

: *CS:GO Anticheat (Win32 Kernel API and C++)*
  Responding to popular demand, SoStronk Anticheat uses powerful kernel-based protection against cheats and other bad actors. The solution tightly integrates a Windows Kernel Driver, NT Service and CS:GO Helper Library. This complexity is invisible to the player with one-click installs and automatic error reporting.
